       "     \"      Estrogens, which are responsible for the growth of many breast cancers, act through the estrogen receptors, ER-alpha and ER-beta, which are ligand-modulated transcription factors and members of the nuclear receptor gene superfamily. ER-alpha and ER-beta are well validated protein targets for various aspects of women's health and breast cancer prevention and treatment. As an essential step in their action as regulators of gene transcription, the ERs recruit various coregulator proteins, both coactivators and corepressors, to the DNA-bound (or protein tethered) ER. These coregulators have various activities: alteration of chromatin architecture, regulation of nucleosome core histone modifications (acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation), and activation of RNA polymerase II. Members of an important coactivator class, the p160s or SRCs (steroid receptor coactivators), interact with the ER by inserting a short LXXLL sequence into a hydrophobic groove on the ER ligand binding domain (LBD) that is stabilized by a specific topology of the C-terminal helix-12 of the LBD when this domain is complexed with ER agonists. This hydrophobic groove provides a novel target for small molecule coactivator binding inhibitors (CBIs) of estrogen signaling (Rodriguez, AL et al. J. Med. Chem. 2004, 47, 600-611). \",\n",
       "     '      Estrogen action is normally blocked by ligands that function as conventional antagonists, binding in the ligand binding pocket to displace estrogen agonists and inducing conformations that are ineffective in binding coactivators. It is possible that estrogen action through ER-alpha and ER-beta could be blocked more effectively by direct competition of their binding to the critical coactivators SRC1 and SRC3 in the hydrophobic groove, rather than indirectly by competitive ligand-based antagonism within the ligand binding pocket. By the direct targeting of the ER-coactivator binding interface with CBIs, a more complete blockade of estrogen action can be achieved to possibly overcome the development of resistance to endocrine therapy that typically occurs in the treatment of breast cancer with both antiestrogens (Clarke, R. et al. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001, 76, 71-84) and aromatase inhibitors (Johnston, SRD and M. Dowsett, Nature Rev. Cancer 2003, 3, 821-831).',\n",
       "     '      To identify novel compounds that act as effective ER-alpha coactivator binding inhibitors (CBIs), a time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) assay has been developed in a 384 well format.  This assay measures the binding of a Cy5-labeled SRC-1 nuclear receptor interaction domain to the ligand binding domain (LBD) of ER-alpha labeled (via a streptavidin-biotin interaction) with a long-lifetime europium chelate.  The interaction of SRC-1 with the LBD of ER-alpha, which is induced in the presence of an agonist like estradiol, brings europium and Cy5 into proximity, leading to FRET signal generation.  Compounds that interfere with the FRET signal are identified as potential coactivator binding inhibitors (CBIs) or conventional ligand antagonists.  A distinction between CBIs and conventional ligand antagonists needs to be done by various counter-screening assays.'],\n",
